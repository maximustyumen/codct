 File:       light_module.h
 Purpose:    This class encapsulates some basic lighting functionality provided
             by OSG. It allows for the creation of up to 8 lights which may
             be modified via the direct OSG::Light interface.
             
             Note that the user requests lights from this module, and should
             not instantiate them on their own, unless they have some way
             of keeping track of which lights have been previously enabled.
             
             Note that a maximum of 8 lights may be added to the scene
             using this module.
                
             Also note that unless light ONE is allocated here, the it will
             be used as the default SceneView light, as it has been in
             the previous tutorials. If light ONE is allocated using this
             class, then there will be no default SceneView light, leaving
             the scene dark save for objects illuminated by allocated lights.
Returns:    N/A
